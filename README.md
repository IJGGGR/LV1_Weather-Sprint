## Review

- Arianna Huntley - Design looks good functionality is good

- Nicolas Gonzaba - Design uses different icons from figma. Could use math.floor to make it so the temperture has no decimal. Favorites is bugged and will re-write itself on new searches without reloading the page. No local storage that remebers where you last were when you close then re-open the page. Forecast days 1-4 appear to have placeholder icons and weather. Timezone is stuck in UTC. Other than that the design looks accurate and the website functions well
